# AI Teaches Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository serves as a personal learning resource that bridges machine learning research papers with practical coding implementations. By converting the formulas and ideas from research papers into code using AI (primarily LLMs), this project enables an integrated learning experience covering theory, machine learning concepts, and programming.

## Technologies
- **PyTorch:** Primary framework for developing the code.
- **Hugging Face Libraries:** Utilized for accessing various open source models and resources.

## Purpose
This repository is designed for personal study, allowing you to:
- Deeply explore and understand machine learning research papers.
- Translate theoretical concepts into executable code.
- Enhance both machine learning and programming skills.

## Note
This project is intended solely for personal use and self-study. The content is structured to support individual exploration and learning without any warranty that they can work under a real eviroment.

## Papers
Below are the references to the papers used in this repository.
